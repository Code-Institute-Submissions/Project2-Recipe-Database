# About this site.

We were presented with a task to reflect what we have learned about javascript.
I took the opportunity to create an recipe search engine where users can key in the main igredients of the type of dish they are looking for and the server returnsa a list of popular dishes with instructions for the user to try
I also imprted an idea from spoonacular to provide the users an estimate how much the dish would cost by keying in the ingredients 
and have returned to them a list and prices of the ingredients they keyed in.
I decided to go for a simple, fresh and easy to navigate webpage so that the user can easily run searches.
